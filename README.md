# Walls Cave Survey software

RIP David McKenzie

## Looking for developers!

I (Andy Edwards) have volunteered to help maintain Walls, but I am by no means a C++ or Visual Studio expert, let alone
familiar with the MFC and probably a number of other old libraries it uses.  If you're a caver and C++ developer, please
let me know if you'd be willing to help, even if you only have time to give me tips whenever I hit a snag.

## Quick Start for Developers

* Install Visual Studio 2015 (community edition is fine)
* Install the `nasm` assembler and make sure it's on your `PATH` 
* Open Walls.sln
* Select a build configuration: `Debug_XP` if you're on Windows XP, or `Debug` otherwise.
* Cross your fingers
* Hit F7 to build the solution
